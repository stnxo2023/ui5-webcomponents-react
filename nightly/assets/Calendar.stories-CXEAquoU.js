Currently selected dates are represented with instances of \`CalendarDate\` as
children of the \`Calendar\`. The value property of each \`CalendarDate\` must be a
date string, correctly formatted according to the \`Calendar\`'s \`formatPattern\` property.
Whenever the user changes the date selection, \`Calendar\` will automatically create/remove instances
of \`CalendarDate\` in itself, unless you prevent this behavior by calling \`preventDefault()\` for the
\`selection-change\` event. This is useful if you want to control the selected dates externally.

### Usage

The user can navigate to a particular date by:

- Pressing over a month inside the months view
- Pressing over an year inside the years view

The user can confirm a date selection by pressing over a date inside the days view.

### Keyboard Handling
The \`Calendar\` provides advanced keyboard handling.
When a picker is showed and focused the user can use the following keyboard
shortcuts in order to perform a navigation:

- Day picker:

- [F4] - Shows month picker
- [Shift] + [F4] - Shows year picker
- [Page Up] - Navigate to the previous month
- [Page Down] - Navigate to the next month
- [Shift] + [Page Up] - Navigate to the previous year
- [Shift] + [Page Down] - Navigate to the next year
- [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [Page Up] - Navigate ten years backwards
- [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [Page Down] - Navigate ten years forwards
- [Home] - Navigate to the first day of the week
- [End] - Navigate to the last day of the week
- [Ctrl] + [Home] - Navigate to the first day of the month
- [Ctrl] + [End] - Navigate to the last day of the month

- Month picker:

- [Page Up] - Navigate to the previous year
- [Page Down] - Navigate to the next year
- [Home] - Navigate to the first month of the current row
- [End] - Navigate to the last month of the current row
- [Ctrl] + [Home] - Navigate to the first month of the current year
- [Ctrl] + [End] - Navigate to the last month of the year

- Year picker:

- [Page Up] - Navigate to the previous year range
- [Page Down] - Navigate the next year range
- [Home] - Navigate to the first year of the current row
- [End] - Navigate to the last year of the current row
- [Ctrl] + [Home] - Navigate to the first year of the current year range
- [Ctrl] + [End] - Navigate to the last year of the current year range

#### Fast Navigation
This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via [F6] / [Shift] + [F6] / [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] / [Down] or [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] + [Up].
In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module:
\`import "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js"\`

### Calendar types
The component supports several calendar types - Gregorian, Buddhist, Islamic, Japanese and Persian.
By default the Gregorian Calendar is used. In order to use the Buddhist, Islamic, Japanese or Persian calendar,
you need to set the \`primaryCalendarType\` property and import one or more of the following modules:

\`import "@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Buddhist.js";\`

\`import "@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Islamic.js";\`

\`import "@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Japanese.js";\`

\`import "@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Persian.js";\`

Or, you can use the global configuration and set the \`calendarType\` key:

\`\`\`html
<script data-id="sap-ui-config" type="application/json">
	{
		"calendarType": "Japanese"
	}
<\/script>
\`\`\`
